    "bio":"I've been in the design field since 2015 and worked on diverse projects ranging from graphic layouts, to high-stake pitch decks, to Wordpress websites. But the day I found UX design, something clicked and I realized that this is the heart of everything I do. I dabble and tinker with a lot of things because my passion is creating a product that people will love to use. To see things from different perspectives helps me bring a more holistic approach to user experience and it's the kind of work that brings me joy.",
